# Invoice App - Frontend Mentor

Howdy!

Thank you for checking out my solution to the [InvoiceApp](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl) challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)!

This is my first 'well documented' project where I spent a lot of time and effort on really grasping concepts and comitting my code much more often and correctly than in the past, I hope it doesn't dissapoint too much üòÅ

## Overview
### Tools I used üõ†:

- **Svelte**: to build the project with, love using this as my first framework ü•∞
- **Vanilla JS**: mostly helper functions and authentication etc
- **Firebase**: For authentication and data management

### Cool features I spent time on üòä:

I worked on the below to ensure full 'immersion' for the user. These were challenges that were new to me 
and I wanted to deliver the best possible design & UI experience. 

- Custom datepicker: This was an intimidating one to create! Explanations below.
- 'Custom' filter buttons: I wanted to build a completely custom experience.
- Login & Sign up forms (first Authentication project, apart from security improvements I think I did alright..)

## What I've learned

This was my first time building a project this big, with so much data flowing in and out of componenets 
that quite frankly the entire project was a splendid learning experience. I feel blessed to have tools like
FrontendMentor at my disposal to speed up the learning process of developing an app.

But here's a list:
- **Creating a datepicker**: This was challenging as I basically sucked at dates when first learning JS. I couldn't grasp the concepts quickly enough. So I decided to spend a Sunday on codepen and just build it from scratch. I ended up building the entire datepicker in vanilla JS by myself with some documentation-aid from MDN. I later converted and refactored this with Svelte. It was an euphoric sort of headache.
- **Difficulty of data structure**: I was a bit blown away and intimidated when studying the design, pondering on how all the data will flow. Whilst being a newbie I'm fascinated with building things that are easy to read, scalable and minimal. And I am now walking away with a new appreciation of why software development, web development etc takes so much time, money and effort. It is extremely difficult to build something GREAT that can be scaled in the future. Amazing lesson to have.
- **Trusting myself with UI**: I altered a smidge of the original design. I found that the design struggled when invoice items had large numbers. So I tweaked the design to be focused on the best way to represent the data, image1 below.
